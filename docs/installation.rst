There are three ways to use Patchview

Stand-along App
-----------------------

If your operating system is Windows 10, PatchView has a prepackaged app using `Pyinstaller`_.  
You can download the zip file from its Github `releases`_ page. After unzipped
it into a folder, you can directly double click the executable file, **PatchView.exe**, to start the app. No
python installation is needed. 

.. _releases: https://github.com/ZeitgeberH/patchview/releases

To remove the app, just delete the whole folder.

**Note**

* It takes about 15 ~ 30 seconds when you run the programme the first time, as compressed libraries needs to be unzipped. 
  It should be much faster for following runs. 

* since Pyinstaller is cross-platform, it is possible to package PatchView for other platform, Mac or Linux. 
  We have not tried these options yet. Contributions are welcome!

Pip install
--------------

To install PatchView via `pip`_, We recommend creating a virtual python environment first.
If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.



If you use conda, you can do this by:

.. code-block:: console
    
    $  conda create -n patchview python=3.8

Note: PatchView require Python>=3.8

After activating your virtual environment, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install patchview

This is the preferred method to install PatchView, as it installs script that can launch
the GUI program at a command line by type

.. code-block:: console

    (patchview) $ patchview

or in a python environment:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import patchview

To launch the GUI, type:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> patchview.pvGUI()

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _Python installation guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/

**Note 1**: PatchView use PyQt5 as its front-end. Pip installation may have compatible issue which may cause the following errors when launch
the GUI::

    qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "windows" in "". This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

If this happens, please uninstall PyQt5, PyQt5-sip, pyqtwebengine by:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip uninstall pyqt5 pyqt5-qt5 pyqtwebengine-qt5 pyqt5-sip

then reinstall them via:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyqt5 pyqtwebengine pyqt5-sip

If this does not resolve the issue, please open a PatchView's github issue.

**Note 2**
Tested platforms: Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Mac Catalina. 
Due to Qt requriment, it won't work under WSL2 in Windows 10. 
With enhanced GUI support on WSL2 in Windows 11, it may work (but not tested yet)

From sources
------------

The sources for PatchView can be downloadeded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/zeitgeberH/patchview

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/zeitgeberH/patchview/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, use Conda to create an virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml

then activate the environment and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda activate patchviewPy3
    
    $ pip install -r requirement.txt ## install requirement

Finally, 

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ pip install -e .
    
.. _Pyinstaller: https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/   
.. _Github repo: https://github.com/zeitgeberH/patchview
.. _tarball: https://github.com/zeitgeberH/patchview/tarball/master


Configuration
----------------

PatchView use a Yaml file for its basic configuration.

* If you use the app version, it is located in the **patchview\\Data\\patchview.yaml** of the app folder.
* If you install it via Pip or from source, it is located in ``user_config_dir`` generated by `appdirs`_,
  
  For Windows: it is **'C:\\Users\\YOUR-USER-NAME\\AppData\\Local\\Patchview\\Patchview'**.

  For Linux: it is **'/home/YOUR-USER-NAME/.config/Patchview'**

.. _appdirs: https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs

Open **patchview.yaml** with any text editor.  

* **RootDir** is the root directory set for PatchView to list files. Leave it empty (**''**) if you want to include all drives in computer. 
* **Protocols** are labels you used for series during recording. There are four default categories that PatchView uses to sort recorded series. Add any labels in the corresponding category if it is not already in the list.

After saving your changes, close the app and restart it.

Test dataset
------------------
Test dataset can be downloaded from Patchview's `Github repo`_, under `tests/data` folder (You can set **RootDir** to that folder for easy browsing). 

**Epy. recordings**:

`test.abf`: a whole-cell recording session in Axon binary file format (ABF).

`test_singleFP.dat`: Ephy. recordings with one firing pattern session 

`test_FP_Spon.dat`: Ephy. recordings with firing pattern, EPSP, EPSC recordings. This can be
used to test the automatic sorting functionality of `patchview`

`connection_tests`: In this folder, there are eight files from a series of multi-patching experiments in which eight neurons 
were patched and recorded simultaneously. In each experiment, one of the neurons was simulated and the rest were recorded in 
current clamped mode. This is a protocol for testing synaptic connections between those neurons. 

**Morphology**:

`test.ASC`: a morphology file in neurolucida format. It contains reconstruction of 
an interneuron in hippcampus. 

`test_multiSoma.ASC`: a morphology file in neurolucida format. It contains reconstruction 
of multiple neurons from a single brain slice. 

**NWB file**:

`test.nwb`: a recording file in neurodata-without-borders format. 


Tests
-----------------
Run pytest in the `tests` folder 

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pytest .
