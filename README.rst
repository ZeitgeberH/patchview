PatchView perform data analysis and visualization on multi channel whole-cell recording (multi-patch) data, including firing pattern analysis, event analysis,
synatpic connection detection, morphological analysis and more.

Features
--------
PatchView integrates multiple open-source tools (see credit page) and wrap them using an intuitive graphic user interface (GUI).
Thus users can perform most analysis quickly for the data collected in a typical patch-clamp experiment without installing Python and 
these tools or writting any Python scripts.


* Importing Heka patchmaster data and Axon file data
* Visualizing single and multiple traces with Zoom-in, Pan operations
* Performing analysis on actiona potential detection, firing pattern analysis
* Synaptic connection analysis
* Mini-event analysis
* Visualizing morphological reconstruction files from Neurolucida
