PatchView perform data analysis and visualization on multi channel whole-cell recording (multi-patch) data, including firing pattern analysis, event analysis,
synaptic connection detection, morphological analysis and more.

* Free software: BSD 3-Clause license
* Documentation: https://patchview.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------
PatchView integrates multiple open-source tools (see credit page) and wrap them using an intuitive graphic user interface (GUI).
Thus users can perform most analysis quickly for the data collected in a typical patch-clamp experiment without installing Python and 
these tools or writing any Python scripts.

* Importing both Heka data and Axon Instruments data. Exporting to Python pickle file or NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) file format.
* Visualizing single and multiple traces with zoom, pan operations.
* Automatically sorting experiments data according to predefined labels.
* Performing analysis on intrinsic membrane properties, action potential detection, firing pattern analysis.
* Synaptic connection analysis.
* Visualizing and quantification of neuron's morphological reconstruction from Neurolucida
