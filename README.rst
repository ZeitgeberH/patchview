Features
--------
Patchview integrates multiple open-source tools (see attribution page) and wrap them using an intuitive graphic user interface (GUI).
Thus users can perform most analysis quickly for the data collected in a typical Patch-seq experiment without installing Python and these tools or writting any Python scripts.


* Importing Heka patchmaster data and Axon file data
* Visualizing single and multiple traces with Zoom-in, Pan operations
* Performing analysis on actiona potential detection, firing pattern analysis
* Mini-event detection
* Visualizing morphorlocial reconstruction files from Neurolucida
