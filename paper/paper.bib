	abstract = {The locus coeruleus (LC) houses the vast majority of noradrenergic neurons in the brain and regulates many fundamental functions. While efferent projections of the LC have been extensively investigated, little is known about its local circuit organization. Here, we performed large-scale multi-patch recordings of LC noradrenergic neurons to profile their morpho-electric properties while simultaneously examining their interactions. LC neurons were diverse and could be classified into two major morpho-electric types. While chemical transmission was not detected, these neurons electrically connected at a rate comparable to many brain regions. Most connections form between dendrites and were restricted to narrowly spaced pairs or small clusters of neurons of the same type. Furthermore, more than two coupled pairs were often identified from individual recording sets that follow a train-like organizational pattern. The assembly of LC neurons follows a spatial and cell type-specific wiring principle that may be imposed by a unique train-like rule.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The neurophysiology of cells and tissues are monitored electrophysiologically and optically in diverse experiments and species, ranging from flies to humans. Understanding the brain requires integration of data across this diversity, and thus these data must be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). This requires a standard language for data and metadata that can coevolve with neuroscience. We describe design and implementation principles for a language for neurophysiology data. Our open-source software (Neurodata Without Borders, NWB) defines and modularizes the interdependent, yet separable, components of a data language. We demonstrate NWB{\textquoteright}s impact through unified description of neurophysiology data across diverse modalities and species. NWB exists in an ecosystem, which includes data management, analysis, visualization, and archive tools. Thus, the NWB data language enables reproduction, interchange, and reuse of diverse neurophysiology data. More broadly, the design principles of NWB are generally applicable to enhance discovery across biology through data FAIRness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
